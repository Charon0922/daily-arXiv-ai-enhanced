Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2 $-$ 500 GeV range, we\ndetect a significant ($ > 35\\sigma $) $\\gamma$-ray emission spatially\ncoincident with the DR21 outflow, located at a distance of 1.5 kpc in the\nCygnus-X star-forming region.

The outer orbit is seen to excite the\ninner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These\nquasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for\ncreating highly eccentric binaries.

We compare some of the properties of this superburst\nand the underlying outburst with the events recorded on May 5 2005 by RXTE and\nmost recently in 2025 by MAXI.

Its\nafterglow displays an unusually long-duration plateau followed by an achromatic\nbreak and a steep decline, deviating from canonical GRB afterglows. While long\nplateaus are often explained by central engine activity, we find that for GRB\n250704B, an energy injection model requires unreasonable parameters.

This paper presents the identification and classification\nof optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3,\nCatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and\ntrained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a\nMachine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a\nreference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were\ncomputed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1\nsources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are\nextragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE,\nGaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less\nreliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features\navailable to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic\nPlane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of\nassociations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately\n18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources.

A major challenge in\nthe simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope,\nexhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a\ngeometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate\nenvelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between\nthe temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface\ntemperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for\napproximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies\nfrom the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard\nprescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be\nused as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural\nnetworks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast\nevaluation necessary in neutron star simulations.

Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring\nand surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination\nof AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability.\nOur main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the\nassumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain\nthe observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc\ntransfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical\nmodel and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model\nallows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the\nscenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an\nexternal source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc\ntransfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power\nspectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars\ndetermined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light\ncurves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of\nquasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\\sim 1300$\\AA\\ up to\n$4000$\\AA.

However, outflows\ncan also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths.\nTherefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is\nworthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic\nwind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code\nSIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric,\nsingle- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles.
